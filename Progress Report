Hello Valeriya.
Release Lab 1-2 is translated from Matlab to python framework and is working properly. The execution time 
of the code is okay, but the plotting may be a bit slow when the datasets gets big.

There are probably better and more efficient ways to get the same results when translating the code. As it is
now, it works and I hope it can serve its purpose.

I am currently working on a GUI for the lab in Python. I am using Tkinter for the GUI, and have set up some of
the layout and a little bit of functionality, but not a lot. Making a GUI for the labs will definitely take some
time. Many details need work for the GUI to look good and perform well.

The two other labs have a lot in common with the Release Lab 1-2, but has more options when it comes to simulating
data and different filters for example. This means that there is not that much more to translate to have all the
labs working in python.

Fortunately it is all in the same framework, so the GUI for Release Lab 1-2 will work for the two other labs as
well, it just needs a few more functions implemented. When the GUI and all the extra functionality is translated,
it will probably need reviews and more documentation. However, right now, I am focusing on getting it to work and
serve its purpose.

This week I have finished the Release Lab 1-2 in Python framework and been doing research on how to make a
GUI in Python. I was a little overwhelmed by all the possibilities when it comes to creating a GUI, but after
choosing a way of doing it, it has been really enjoyable doing, I have learnt a lot and feel like I am
making good progress.

I have made a Github Repository for all the translated Python files and the little start I got on the GUI.

I am looking forward to pick up where I left of in three weeks!
